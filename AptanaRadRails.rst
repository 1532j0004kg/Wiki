Aptana RadRails plugin for Eclipse
================================================================================

Install the Radrails Plug-in for Eclipse (optional)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial assumes that you have a working installation of Eclipse IDE
(preferably Ganymede or later). After having a working Java installation this
step should be pretty easy (I usually install the provided Java packages of my
distribution). It is suggested to install Eclipse into one's home directory,
since Eclipse's built-in plug-in installation system works most seamlessly
that way. Downloading the Eclipse tar-ball (for Linux of course) and
extracting it in your home directory should suffice. You may want to add the
path where your eclipse executable resides to your PATH variable.

After installing Eclipse, make sure you execute the following command,
otherwise you may not be able to install Eclipse plug-ins.::

    #>  apt-get install eclipse-pde

Install Aptana Radrails
********************************************************************************

* Start Eclipse (as normal user, *not* root)
* Go to: ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù - ‚ÄúInstall New Software‚Äù
* Click on ‚ÄúAdd Site‚Äù (*Note:* The next 4 steps for determining the URL to
  enter next work as of September 15, 2009; Maybe these steps need a little
  adaption at some point later)
* Go to http://www.aptana.com/radrails using your preferred Web browser
* Click on "Download Now"
* Select "Eclipse Plugin" from the drop down selection menu and click on
  "Download Now"
* Record URL mentioned there: e.g. http://update15.aptana.org/studio/26124/
* Back in Eclipse: Enter the URL determined by the previous step
* Select (check) ‚ÄúAptana Studio‚Äù from the URL entered as "New Site"
  previously
* Click "Install..." and click the ‚ÄúNext >‚Äù button
* Read the License Agreement, accept the terms, and click the
  ‚ÄúFinish >‚Äù button.
* When it is recommended that Eclipse be restarted click ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.
* After the restart, you will be asked to install something from Aptana
  Studio Site
* Select (check) "Aptana RadRails" and click "Next >"
* Read the License Agreement, accept the terms, and click the ‚ÄúNext >‚Äù button.
* The downloads should be installed into the .eclipse folder in your home
  directory by default. If this is acceptable click the ‚ÄúFinish‚Äù button.
* Wait for the downloads to complete.
* When it is recommended that Eclipse be restarted click ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.

**Check Ruby and Rails Configuration**

If you are asked if you want to auto-install some gems it is up to you to
install them or not (I did).

* Go to "Window" - "Preferences"
* Select "Ruby" - "Installed Interpreters"
* The selected Ruby interpreter should be in /usr
* Now, go to "Rails"
* Rails should be auto-detected as well as Mongrel

Install EGit
********************************************************************************

* Again go to: ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù - ‚ÄúInstall New Software...‚Äù
* Check if the EGit update site is available (in ‚ÄúAvailable Software Sites‚Äù. Its
  URL is ‚Äúhttp://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates‚Äù.
* If not available, click on ‚ÄúAdd Site‚Äù
* Enter Location: ‚Äúhttp://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates‚Äù
* The rest of the installation should be really straight forward.
* Check out the EGit user guide: http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide

Checkout MarkUs Source Code
********************************************************************************

* Create a Github user account
* Got to http://github.com/MarkusProject/Markus
* "Fork" the MarkUs repository, by clicking the "Fork" button.
* Figure out the Git clone URL of your fork. Should be something like
  git@github.com:<yourgithub-username>/Markus.git
* Start Eclipse and switch to the RadRails perspective
* Clone the MarkUs repository of your Github fork (use URL as described above) as described here:
  http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Cloning_Remote_Repositories

Getting Started with MarkUs Development
********************************************************************************

First, we need to configure MarkUs. Please have a careful look at
config/environment.rb (and please read the comments) and config/database.yml


Start your newly installed RadRails and by using the "Ruby Explorer" navigate
to folder "config" and copy the file "database.yml.myslq" (or
"database.yml.postgres" depending on the DB you are using). Paste and rename it
to "database.yml". Now open the newly created "database.yml" file and modify
the "username: ..." and "password: ..." lines as follows (make sure this DB
user actually exists and works)::

    username: markus
    password: markus-password

Do that for "development", "test" and "production" and save your modified
"database.yml".

Now switch to the "Rake Tasks" view.

* If you get an error message complaining about the absence of RakeFile in
the project, go to "Window" - "Preferences", then in "Ruby" - "Rake" and
enter your rake path, e.g. "/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/rake" (the rake version
installed by gem, not the debian package). Click "OK" to close the dialog.
Restart Eclipse.*

* If the error persists, try running rake --tasks from the command line

     * If it doesn't work in the command line, it won't work in Aptana

Make sure that you have rubygems > 1.3.7 and bundler installed. You most
likely have to do that on the commandline.

If that succeeded, then you are ready to try in Aptana's Rake console:

Run, in order,::

* db:create
* db:schema:load
* db:populate
* db:test:prepare
* test:units
* test:functionals


by selecting them and clicking on the "Play"-like button on the right. The
output of rake should show up in the "Console" view.

Finally go back to RadRails and switch to the "Servers" view. There should be
a server named exactly the same as your Rails project. Select it and start it
using the "Start server" icon (it looks like a "Play" key). Once the server is
started, check the port the server is listening on, fire up your Web-browser
(or use the Eclipse built-in) and go to "http://localhost:\<serverport\>/" and
log in with username "a" and any password (it must not be empty). That's it!

If the login in fails with an error message similar to::

    /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/activesupport-2.3.5/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:380:
           command not found: /home/jmate/Aptana RadRails Workspace/MarkUs/config/dummy_validate.sh
           [4;36;1mSQL (0.2ms)[0m   [0;1mSET client_min_messages TO 'panic'[0m
           [4;35;1mSQL (0.1ms)[0m   [0mSET client_min_messages TO 'notice'[0m

then you will have to go to /config/environments/development.rb and change
VALIDATE_FILE to the absolute path to the config/dummy_validate.sh file with
the characters properly escaped. Example::

    VALIDATE_FILE = "/home/jmate/Aptana\\ RadRails\\ Workspace/MarkUs/config/dummy_validate.sh"
