Developing MarkUs with RVM
===========================

RVM
---

RVM (Ruby Version Manager) is a command line tool which allows us to easily install, manage and work with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems.

Official website: [https://rvm.io](https://rvm.io)

RVM can help you working with different versions of Ruby with MarkUs (or other projets). Here, you will find particular installation instructions for setting-up a RVM environment with MarkUs

Install RVM
-----------

First, install RVM:

    $ sudo apt-get install curl
    $ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

Next, install Rubies (Ruby 1.9.3, Ruby 2.1.2, JRuby, Rubiniusâ€¦)

> $ rvm install ruby-2.1.2

### Ruby

MarkUs stable tree works only with Ruby 1.9.3 or newer. Ruby 2.1.2 is the current stable release as of this writing, so we will install it by default, to ensure everything is build correctly:

    $ rvm install 1.9.3
    $ rvm install 2.1.2

Now, if you do \`rvm list\`, you will see two version of ruby available. You can choose one by doing \`rvm use 1.9.3\` or \`rvm use 2.1.2\`.

**Note:** You can check at each moment your version of Ruby by doing \`ruby -v\`

To make a version of ruby default:

    $ rvm --default use 2.1.2

### Rubygems

Don't forget to re-do a \`bundle install\` in your MarkUs root repository for each Ruby that you install.

### Subversion Ruby bindings with RVM


Update RVM
----------

If a new version of Ruby is out, you will want to install it.

First, you will have to update RVM (for example, Ruby-2.2.0 is out, and I used Ruby-2.1.2):

    $ rvm get stable
    $ rvm install 2.2.0

**Note** Use the same options as before if you need them. Moreover, don't forget to recompile libsvn-ruby for this version of Ruby! You will have to reinstall all gems too.
